### Unit 1 / Week 3
Learning outcome: 
- Weekend/Monday: Holiday, but have plan for pair showcase completed. My partner and I chose option 2 and decided to make a Tron game using JavaScript. We will try to include interactions with python by diplaying tips whenever a player loses and with linux to keep track of scores, deaths, and kills. ![](images/project.png) 
- Tuesday: Start making/finding JavaScript code for Tron game. Consult Mr. Mortensen, peers, and/or ChatGPT for help.
- Wednesday: Continue to edit game code to make its appearance cleaner (adjust to theme of website), movements smoother, etc. Sign up for pair showcase (Friday).
- Thursday: Create interactions in other languages (Python and Linux). If we can only get one of them, make sure we can present what we have well and describe what our code does in depth.
- Friday: Quickly practice presentation aspect, then complete pair showcase. Don't be nervous!!


### Pair Showcase Prep
- Create Tron game with interactions in JavaScript, Python, and Linux
- Discuss problems we faced and how we overcame challenges
    - Tron game code did not have collision logic (nobody could win or lose)
        - Matthew's idea: create grid background --> whenever pixels overlap, game ends (found code for it)
