### Unit 1 / Week 3
- Weekend/Monday: Holiday, but have plan for pair showcase completed. My partner and I chose option 2 and decided to make a Tron game using JavaScript. We will try to include interactions with python by diplaying tips whenever a player loses and with linux to keep track of scores, deaths, and kills.

- Tuesday: Start making/finding JavaScript code for Tron game. Consult Mr. Mortensen, peers, and/or ChatGPT for help. Make sure to read code carefully and edit as necessary.
- Wednesday: Continue to edit game code to make its appearance cleaner (adjust to theme of website), movements smoother, etc. Sign up for pair showcase (Friday).
- Thursday: Create interactions in other languages (Python and Linux). Make sure we can present our project in depth.
- Friday: Practice presentation aspect, then complete pair showcase. Don't be nervous!!


### Pair Showcase Prep
- Create Tron game with interactions in JavaScript, Python, and Linux
- Customize game appearance with colors, etc.
    - Tried to add Mr. Mortensen as a player but unfortunately did not work (might try again later)

Actual presenting part:
- Talk about our code (javascript game code, game tip python, linux quiz)
    - **JS**: similar concept to snake --> needed a new function for players everytime --> class; first code didn;t have working collision logic --> playable cells
    - **Python**: searches web with key words, parsed through websites, list of randomized phrases that are displayed for losing player
    - **Linux**: quiz code --> doesn't work in jupyter notebook but does in terminal (jupyter can't read input)
- Discuss problems we faced and how we overcame challenges
    - Beginning Tron game code did not have collision logic (nobody could win or lose)
        - Tried to ask ChatGPT but did not get successful responses
        - Needed to create grid background --> whenever units overlap, game ends
    - Difficulties integrating python in javascript game
        - Made a ipynb file in _notebooks and connected it to javascript code
        - Now displays websites that have gaming tips for the losing player
