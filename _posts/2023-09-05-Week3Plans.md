### Unit 1 / Week 3
Learning outcome: 
- Weekend/Monday: Holiday, but have plan for pair showcase completed. My partner and I chose option 2 and decided to make a Tron game using JavaScript. We will try to include interactions with python by diplaying tips whenever a player loses and with linux to keep track of scores, deaths, and kills. ![](images/project.png) 
- Tuesday: Start making/finding JavaScript code for Tron game. Consult Mr. Mortensen, peers, and/or ChatGPT for help.
- Wednesday: Continue to edit game code to make its appearance cleaner (adjust to theme of website), movements smoother, etc. Sign up for pair showcase (Friday).
- Thursday: Create interactions in other languages (Python and Linux). Make sure we can present our project in depth.
- Friday: Practice presentation aspect, then complete pair showcase. Don't be nervous!!


### Pair Showcase Prep
- Create Tron game with interactions in JavaScript, Python, and Linux
- Customize game appearance with colors, etc.
    - Tried to add Mr. Mortensen as a player but unfortunately did not work (might try again later)

Actual presenting part:
- Talk about our code (javascript game code, game tip python, linux quiz)
    - JS: basic layout of game, player settings (keys and color), playablecells create the grid canvas and also plays a major role in collision logic, winning/losing/drawing a game function, end screen has code that displays winner/reset game button/gaming tips, reset code connected to reset button (very straightforward if you can read)
    - Python: installed newspaper in order to import article/website, list of randomized phrases that are displayed for losing player, search for gaming tip articles
    - Linux: **tbd
- Discuss problems we faced and how we overcame challenges
    - Beginning Tron game code did not have collision logic (nobody could win or lose)
        - Tried to ask ChatGPT but did not get successful responses
        - Needed to create grid background --> whenever units overlap, game ends (found code for it)
    - Difficulties integrating python in javascript game
        - Made a ipynb file in _notebooks and connected it to javascript code
        - Now displays websites that have gaming tips for the losing player
    - Had to change our plan for the Linux interaction (we were too amitious)
        - Ended up making a Linux quiz about our project
