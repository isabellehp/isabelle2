### Live Review Prep
- Talk about what we have / did this week
- Continue to add hacks and stuff to lab notebook
- Discuss problems we faced and how we overcame challenges
    - Jupyter Notebook
        - Error loading notebook --> needed to select kernel (python)
        - Code no running because ipykernel wasn't updated --> pip install -upgrade ipykernel
    - Beginning lab notebook: html files/code not saving in _site because I didn't make an .md file for them
    - Changing baseurl messed up my whole website
        - None of the header tabs worked --> needed to change baseurl in sites
