## Collections
Blog Python Model code and SQLite Database.
- SQLite database contains the data of users login information
- Includes name, username, password, and date of birth
- Test data from our created users (Chrissie, Isabelle, Sreeja, Nupur)

From VSCode using SQLite3 Editor, show your unique collection/table in database, display rows and columns in the table of the SQLite database.

## Frontend
### Login
Blog JavaScript API fetch code and formatting code to display JSON.

In Chrome inspect, show response of JSON objects from fetch of GET, POST, and UPDATE methods.

<a href="https://ibb.co/wJcCR6J"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/n3Pfbk3/Screenshot-2024-04-18-230442.png"></a>

- Our login uses POST method for fetch:
<a href="https://ibb.co/xDgT1fQ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bPv9s2n/Screenshot-2024-04-18-003359.png"></a>

In JavaScript code, describe fetch and method that obtained the Array of JSON objects.

In JavaScript code, show code that performs iteration and formatting of data into HTML.
In the Chrome browser, show a demo (POST or UPDATE) gathering and sending input and receiving a response that show update. Repeat this demo showing both success and failure.

In JavaScript code, show and describe code that handles success. Describe how code shows success to the user in the Chrome Browser screen.
In JavaScript code, show and describe code that handles failure. Describe how the code shows failure to the user in the Chrome Browser screen.

The code below shows what happens after correctly or incorrectly logging in. If the login is successful, the user will be redirected to the welcome page. If the login fails, an error message will appear on the page.

When I enter the correct username and password (Isabelle and 123belle, respectively), I am redirected to the project's homepage:

<a href="https://ibb.co/chc1tcn"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/k2gx0gC/Screenshot-2024-04-18-094010.png"></a>

Here I entered my username (Isabelle) but I used the wrong password (hi instead of 123belle). I then got the error as written in the code:
