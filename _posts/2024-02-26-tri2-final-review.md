## Summary of CPT Project
My group and I created a webpage/project relating to mental health. Our target audience was high schoolers since we are familiar with their preferences in aesthetics, values, etc. We have many features that track the progression or help improve mental health in teenagers.

During this CPT project, I mainly worked on coding frontend. Both Hannah and I explored a lot with styling and designing an aesthetic webpage that aims to ease mental health. However, we did assist our other teammates (Prakruti and Vidha) with the sign-up and login aspect of this project.

## My Feature
For this project, I made a mood tracker feature. It shows four different emojis (happy, neutral, sad, mad). The user clicks on one of the emojis that best represents their mood that day. After the button is clicked, the emoji is added to that day on a calendar that records their mood variation during that month.
