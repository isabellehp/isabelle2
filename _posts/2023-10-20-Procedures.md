## What is a procedure?
A procedure is a named group of programming instructions with a purpose and may have parameters/return values. A procedure call disrupts the normal flow of executing statements in a program by executing the statements within the procedure first. After all the statements in the procedure (or a return statement) have run, the program's control flow returns to the point right after the procedure was initially called. 
It is extremely important to name the procedure something that describes the purpose, method, or function because it makes it easier for others to read your code and for yourself when you revisit old code. Additionally, when there is an effefctively named procedure, it is much simpler to correct bugs and errors.
## Important Vocabulary
*Parameters*: input values of a procedure
*Arguments*: specify the parameter values when a procedure is called


A procedure call is like a pause button in a computer program. When you call a procedure, the program stops doing what it was doing and starts doing what's in the procedure. Once the procedure is done, the program goes back to where it left off.
